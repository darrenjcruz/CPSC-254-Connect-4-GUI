Group Project for CPSC254 in which we will be creating a Connect 4 game. The Connect 4 game will have six user features that will be designed. It will have 

* 1. Connect four game functionality 

* 2. User profiles like the old arcades that let you enter your name

* 3. Leaderboard/stats which get stored next to your user profile that you create like an old arcade game 

* 4. A tutorial/how to play page that will show users how to use our software 

* 5. A reset function that will start the game over 

* 6. The ability to save your game state and come back to it later
